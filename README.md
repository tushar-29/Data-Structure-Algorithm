# Data Structure Algorithm in C/C++

Basic : 
    -> variables
    -> operators
    -> if else
    -> while
    -> for
    -> switch
    -> function
    -> pass by value to function (for array, variable, structure, class)
    -> passby reference to function (for array, variable, structure, class)
    -> structure
    -> pointers
    ->class
    -> matrix or 2D array
  
Reccurssion : 
    -> Basic Reccursion
    -> Finding sum of n number
    -> Finding factorial of n number
    -> Taylor Series Expansion
    -> Fibonacci Series
    -> Exponent
    -> Combination
    -> Tower of honoi
    
 Array :
    -> Basic notes on array
    -> 2D array access concept
    -> Array and pointer access
    -> Array ADT(append, pop, insert, remove, get_index, sort, search etc...)
    -> Finding Duplicate in array


Strings : 
    -> length
    -> check palindrome
    -> permutation
    -> reverse
    -> validation
    -> change case
    -> check anagram
